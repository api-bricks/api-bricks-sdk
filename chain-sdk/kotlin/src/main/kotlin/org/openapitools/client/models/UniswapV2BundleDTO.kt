/**
 * The Bundle is used as a global store of derived ETH price in USD. Because there is no guaranteed common base token across pairs, a global reference of USD price is useful for deriving other USD values. The Bundle entity stores an updated weighted average of ETH<->Stablecoin pair prices. This provides a strong estimate for the USD price of ETH.
