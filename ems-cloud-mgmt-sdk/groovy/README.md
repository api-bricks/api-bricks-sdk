This section will provide necessary information about the `CoinAPI EMS REST API` protocol.
<br/>
This API is also available in the Postman application: <a href=\"https://postman.coinapi.io/\" target=\"_blank\">https://postman.coinapi.io/</a>

### Authentication
If the software is deployed as `Self-Hosted` then API do not require authentication as inside your infrastructure, your company is responsible for the security and access controls. 
<br/><br/>
If the software is deployed in our `Managed Cloud`, there are 2 methods for authenticating with us, you only need to use one:

 1. Custom authorization header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` with the API Key
 2. Query string parameter named `apikey` with the API Key
 3. <a href=\"#certificate\">TLS Client Certificate</a> from the `Managed Cloud REST API` (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) while establishing a TLS session with us.

#### Custom authorization header
You can authorize by providing additional custom header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` and API key as its value.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like:
<br/><br/>
`X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"success\">This method is recommended by us and you should use it in production environments.</aside>
#### Query string authorization parameter
You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named `apikey` with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY` and that you want to request all balances, then your query string should look like this: 
<br/><br/>
`GET /v1/balances?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"notice\">Query string method may be more practical for development activities.</aside>

## Getting Started


```groovy
def apiInstance = new BalancesApi()
def exchangeId = "KRAKEN" // String | Filter the balances to the specific exchange.

apiInstance.v1BalancesGet(exchangeId)
    {
    // on success
    def result = (List&lt;Balance&gt;)it
    println result
    
}
    {
    // on failure
    statusCode, message ->
        println "${statusCode} ${message}"
};
```
