# C++ API client

This section will provide necessary information about the `CoinAPI EMS REST API` protocol.
This API is also available in the Postman application: <a href=\"https://postman.coinapi.io/\" target=\"_blank\">https://postman.coinapi.io/</a>      

Implemented Standards:

  * [HTTP1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945)
  * [HTTP1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
  * [HTTP2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540)
   
### Endpoints

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Deployment method</th>
      <th>Environment</th>
      <th>Url</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Managed Cloud</td>
      <td>Production</td>
      <td>Use <a href=\"#ems-docs-sh\">Managed Cloud REST API /v1/locations</a> to get specific endpoints to each server site where your deployments span</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Self Hosted</td>
      <td>Production</td>
      <td>IP Address of the <code>ems-gateway</code> container/excecutable in the closest server site to the caller location</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Authentication
If the software is deployed as `Self-Hosted` then API do not require authentication as inside your infrastructure, your company is responsible for the security and access controls. 
If the software is deployed in our `Managed Cloud`, there are 2 methods for authenticating with us, you only need to use one:

 1. Custom authorization header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` with the API Key
 2. Query string parameter named `apikey` with the API Key
 3. <a href=\"#certificate\">TLS Client Certificate</a> from the `Managed Cloud REST API` (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) while establishing a TLS session with us.

#### Custom authorization header
You can authorize by providing additional custom header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` and API key as its value.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like: `X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"success\">This method is recommended by us and you should use it in production environments.</aside>
#### Query string authorization parameter
You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named `apikey` with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY` and that you want to request all balances, then your query string should look like this: `GET /v1/balances?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"notice\">Query string method may be more practical for development activities.</aside>

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install [cpprestsdk](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk).

- Windows: `vcpkg install cpprestsdk cpprestsdk:x64-windows boost-uuid boost-uuid:x64-windows`
- Mac: `brew install cpprestsdk`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install libcpprest-dev`

### Build

```sh
cmake -DCPPREST_ROOT=/usr -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
make
```

### Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2017)

- Right click on folder containing source code
- Select 'Open in visual studio'
- Once visual studio opens, CMake should show up in top menu bar.
- Select CMake > Build All.

*Note: If the CMake menu item doesn't show up in Visual Studio, CMake
for Visual Studio must be installed. In this case, open the 'Visual Studio
Installer' application. Select 'modify' Visual Studio 2017. Make sure
'Desktop Development with C++' is installed, and specifically that 'Visual
C++ tools for CMake' is selected in the 'Installation Details' section.

Also be sure to review the CMakeLists.txt file. Edits are likely required.*
